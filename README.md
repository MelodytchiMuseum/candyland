# Candyland
Simple virtual rendition of the Candyland board game made as a backup plan for a final project in a class should the initial project planned (a much more complicated board game) not work correctly. Programmed entirely by me.

Though a GUI was planned, it was never implemented as the other project came through. I did not test this code before uploading it, but I did read through it and it seems like it should all work, albeit through command line.
